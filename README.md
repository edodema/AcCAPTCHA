## ToDO
### Interface
The interface should allow users to configure what devices and modalities they can support when first started, optionally to reconfigure it.
E.g. sight, hearing, keyboard + mouse.
Add a default setting in which we assume a user is totally able to use everything.

### Sight
- Classification
- Identification

### Hearing
- Which sound is louder?
- Classify a sound

### Speech
- Emit a specific sound.
- Read something aloud.

### Gesture
- Move your head or face into a specific box, box may have different colors.
- Finger counting.

### Misc
- Maybe put everything in a Docker image.
