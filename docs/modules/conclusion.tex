\section{Conclusions}
In this work I developed a multimodal system to tell humans apart from bots, with the aim to help people with disabilities that may have a difficult time with CAPTCHAs.
Unfortunately I do not have the resources to state if it does its work and correctly distinguishes between humans and bots; thus this work should be taken, at least for now, as demonstrative.
The app can be accessed on the web to make it easier, for sure there is still a lot of work to do to make it completely usable, yet is a good starting point.
Future works comprehend (i) deploy the system such that it will be effectively useful, (iii) making the system easily accessible to the user and (iii) constantly research for the best models and employ them, striving for a more secure system.
Furtherly, a look at the requirements (section \ref{sec:architecture:requirements}) can give some hints on which functionalities could be implemented, improved or guaranteed in the future.
